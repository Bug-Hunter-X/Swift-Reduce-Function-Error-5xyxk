This repository contains a simple Swift program that demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce` function. The original code uses the '+' operator incorrectly which can lead to incorrect sums.

The `bug.swift` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected version.
